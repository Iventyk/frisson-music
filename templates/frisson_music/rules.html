      <h4>Rules for Filling Album Information:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Album Title:</strong> Must be the official album name. Double-check spelling, punctuation, and
          capitalization.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Media Title:</strong> Enter the correct series, anime, movie, or game name. Avoid abbreviations or
          fan translations.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Media Type:</strong> Must be accurate: choose between <em>anime</em>, <em>series</em>,
          <em>movie</em>, or <em>game</em>. Incorrect media type will cause confusion in sorting and categorization.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Part / Season:</strong> For <em>movies</em> and <em>games</em>, fill in the Part number. For <em>anime</em>
          and <em>series</em>, fill in the Season number. If unknown, leave empty but do not invent values.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Artists:</strong> List all contributing artists exactly as credited in the album.</li>
        <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> Use the official release date (YYYY-MM-DD). Check multiple sources if unsure.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cover Image URL:</strong> Provide a valid link to the album cover. Ensure image is publicly
          accessible and correct.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tracklist:</strong> Include all official tracks in order. Avoid fan-made edits or missing tracks.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Optional but, if included, must be factual, concise, and neutral.</li>
        <li><strong>Spotify URL:</strong> Optional. Must link to the official album page on Spotify, if available.</li>
      </ul>
